php stands for hyper text pre processor
php is an embedded scrippting lang when used in web pages. this means that php code is embedded in html code
when php lang statments ate procesed only the output is sent by the web server to web browser. the php lang statments are not included in output, so the php code is secure and transparent to the user
ex.....<?php echo "<p>hello world";?>
<?php........is the php opening tag
?>........ is the closing tag
echo....... is php instruction to output the upcoming text
the php software processes the php statment and ouptput this
<p>hello world.........which is a regulat heml statement.
html statement is delivered to browser, and it interpret it as html code and display a web page as
hello world
php statement is not delivered to browser,user never sees any php statements
php and the web server must work closely together
